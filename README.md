# Programming for Data Science with Python
This is a repository for the projects I worked on for the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

| Project | Libraries and Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|
|[DVD Rental Database](https://github.com/Hannahllmm/Programming-with-Python/tree/cc73e4f0eacf1f2d493f24cb4921bb3e1cbe0431/Project%201%3A%20DVD%20Rental%20Database)|SQL, Power BI| This was the first project as part of the Programming for Data Science Nanaodegree with Udacity. I investigated a database related to DVD rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries to answer questions about the database. I then used Power BI to visualise that data. |
|[US Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/Hannahllmm/Programming-with-Python/tree/cc73e4f0eacf1f2d493f24cb4921bb3e1cbe0431/Project%202%3A%20US%20Bikeshare%20Data)| Git Bash, Pandas, NumPy| In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.|

## Summary
This was the first project as part of the Programming for Data Science Nanaodegree with Udacity. I investigated a database related to DVD rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries to answer questions about the database. I then used Power BI to visualise this data. This is the entity relationship diagram for the DVD Rental database:

## Questions Posed
1. Does the length of a film title affect the number of times a film is rented?
2. Who are the 10 customers that have rented the most films?
3. Looking at the top 100 most frequent customers, and the film category they each rented the most from, which category was the most popular?
